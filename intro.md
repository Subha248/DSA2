### 🧠 **What She’s Teaching Here:**

Topic: **"How does Java code run?"**

This is a **very common question** in interviews:

> **"Explain the Java code execution process."**

She’s breaking it into two parts:

---

### 🔁 1. **Compilation (with JDK):**

* You write your Java **source code** → `.java` file.
* The **JDK (Java Development Kit)** compiles it using a **compiler**.
* Output: `.class` file → called **Bytecode** (machine-independent code).

```plaintext
Source Code (.java) → [Compiler from JDK] → Bytecode (.class)
```

---

### 🚀 2. **Execution (with JRE → JVM):**

* This **Bytecode** runs on **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
* **JVM** is inside **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**.
* JVM converts the bytecode into **machine-specific instructions**.

```plaintext
Bytecode (.class) → JVM → Machine Code → Runs on your system
```

So you can run the same `.class` file on **any machine (Windows, Mac, Linux)** that has a JVM → this is called **platform independence**.

---

### 📌 Interview Question:

> “How is Java platform-independent?”
> ✅ Because Java compiles to **bytecode**, and the **JVM** runs it on any OS.

### ❓Why Java over C++ for Interviews & Placements?

| 🔹 Java                                         | 🔸 C++                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Platform-independent (JVM)                      | Platform-dependent                      |
| Built-in memory management (GC)                 | Manual memory management (delete, free) |
| Clean, readable syntax                          | Slightly more complex syntax            |
| Standard libraries (Collections, Strings, etc.) | STL (but less beginner-friendly)        |
| Easy for OOP concepts                           | OOP, but with more low-level control    |
| Safe (no pointers)                              | Pointers → unsafe if misused            |

### 🧡 When **to choose Java**:

* You’re focusing on **placements**, **DSA**, or **development**.
* You want to avoid pointer bugs.
* You want to write **less error-prone code**.
